Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am an AI & Cybersecurity Executive with 23+ years of global experience driving innovation across government, defense, critical infrastructure, and enterprise.

My career journey has spanned from building advanced data science platforms for the European Commission to spearheading agentic AI strategies at ST Engineering, where I lead the development of next-generation AI capabilities for national and enterprise security.

I hold a Ph.D. in Business Administration (AI & Disruptive Innovation) and a Masterâ€™s in Data Science (RIT), with a focus on how humans and AI collaborate in decision-making, job transformation, and automation.

Recognized for transforming foresight into execution, I:

Authored and executed a corporate Infosec AI Strategy that forecasted the rise of agentic AI years ahead of industry trends.

Built and scaled high-performance AI teams, securing funding and national recognition.

Led flagship AI partnerships with defense agencies and enterprises bridging public, private, and critical infrastructure domains.

Delivered the first production-grade agentic AI SOC platform, now expanding into ASEAN and Middle Eastern markets.

Today, my mission is to shape the boardroom agenda for AIâ€”helping organizations, governments, and enterprises harness AI responsibly, securely, and at scale.
