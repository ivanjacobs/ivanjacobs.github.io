    "text": "Sources: Matthew N. Bernstein blog, Deep Learning Book, Ian Good Fellow\nThe term inference usually refers to computing the probability distribution of a set of variable when provided another set of variables. We usually are interested in computing \\(p(z|v)\\), in a context of latent variable or multitask learning when the task is defined by a vector \\(z\\). The challenge lays in the difficulty of computing \\(p(z|v)\\) or the expected value with respect to it \\(E_{z‚àºp(z|v)}\\)\nIntractable inference in deep learning arises from the connections between the activations generated from the multitude of layers that create either mutual ancestors or large cliques of activations. In order to solve the intractable inference problem we may approach it as an optimization problem and derive approximate inference algorithms that will approximate the underlying exact inference optimization.\nTo define an optimization problem we can assume that we have an observed data \\(v\\) that is a realization of a random variable \\(V\\). We put forward the existence of another random variable \\(Z\\) and \\(V\\) and \\(Z\\) are distributed according a joint distribution \\(p(X,Z;\\theta)\\) where \\(\\theta\\) parameterizes the distribution. The joint distribution indicates that \\(Z\\) and \\(V\\) are strongly correlated. Suppose \\(m_z,m_v\\) are the means of \\(z\\) and \\(v\\) and are known, then we might be interested in the \\(\\sigma_{zv}\\) the covariance that measures the connection of \\(z\\) and \\(v\\). \\[\\sigma_{zv}=E[(z-m_z)(v-m_v)] \\tag{1}\\]\nHence, to compute \\(\\sigma_{zv}\\) it is not enough to know the probability of \\(z\\) and the probability of each \\(v\\) but the joint probability of each pair \\(z\\) and \\(v\\).\nSuppose we run separate 2 experiments, the covariance between experiments for all pairs of \\(z_i\\) and \\(v_j\\) then equation (Equation¬†1)looks like:\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma_{12}=E([(z-m_1)(v-m_2)])\n\\\\\n\\sigma_{12}=\\sum_{all}\\sum_{ij}p_{ij}(z_i-m_1)(y_j-m_2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\] But \\(v\\) is a realization from \\(V\\) and not from \\(Z\\) and therefor \\(z\\) remains ‚Äúlatent‚Äù i.e.¬†not observed. We might be interested in either computing the posteriour distribution \\(p(Z|V;\\theta)\\) given a fixed \\(\\theta\\) or finding the maximum likelihood \\(argmaxv_{\\theta}l(\\theta)\\) where \\(l(\\theta)\\) is the log-likelihood function given an unknown \\(\\theta\\) defined by: \\[\nl(\\theta):=\\log p(v;\\theta)=\\log\\int_{z}p(v,z;\\theta)dz\n\\tag{3}\\] We could envisage to compute the log-probability of the observed variable \\(v\\) \\(\\log p(v;\\theta)\\) but sometimes it is is to costly to marginalize out \\(h\\) and this computation becomes difficult. Instead we can compute the evidence lower bound (ELBO) or variatonal free energy \\(\\mathcal{L}(v,\\theta,q)\\) on \\(\\log(v;\\theta)\\). The evidence, in evidence lower bound, is the likelihood evaluated at a fixed \\(\\theta\\) : \\[\nevidence:\\log p(v;\\theta)\n\\tag{4}\\]\nHence, if we have approximated \\(\\theta\\) well enough through our optimization approach we would expect that the marginal probability of the observed variable \\(v\\) will be high. The evidence thus quantifies the quality of the approximation of \\(p_{model}\\) parameterized by \\(\\theta\\) of \\(p_{data}\\) i.e.¬†\\(p_{model}(z|v;\\theta)\\approx p_{data}(z|v)\\).\nIf we consider that \\(Z\\) follows an arbitrary probability distribution \\(q\\) and that the joint distribution \\(p(v,z;\\theta):=p(v|z;\\theta)q(z)\\), then the evidence lower bound is the lower bound on the evidence that makes use of \\(q\\). Concretely : \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log p(v;\\theta)\\ge \\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim q}\\left[ \\log \\frac{p(v;z;\\theta)}{q(z)} \\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5}\\] where ELBO is the right-hand side of Equation¬†5\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nELBO:= \\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim q}\\left[ \\log \\frac{p(v;z;\\theta)}{q(z)} \\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe gap between the the evidence and the ELBO is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between \\(p(z|v;\\theta)\\). \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_{KL}(q(z)|| p(z|v;\\theta))\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7}\\] This lays the basis of the approximation approach called variational inference where we learn to infer \\(q\\) through optimization algorithm. As long as \\(z\\) is continuous, we can back-propagate through samples of \\(z\\) dawn from \\(q(z|v)=q(z;f(v;\\theta))\\) to obtain a gradient with respect to \\(\\theta\\) in order to maximize \\(\\mathcal{L}(v,\\theta,q)\\). We can write \\(\\mathcal{L}(v,\\theta,q)\\) as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}(v,\\theta,q)=\\log p(v;\\theta) - D_{KL}(q(z|v)||p(z|v;\\theta))\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nwhere \\(q\\) is an arbitrary probability distribution over \\(z\\). The difference between the expectation \\(\\log p(v)\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}(v,\\theta,q)\\) is given by the KL divergence that is always positive. We can conclude that \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) has at most the same value as the desired log-probability. If the two are equal \\(q\\) has the same distribution as \\(p(z|v)\\)\nWe can rearrange \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) into:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}(v,\\theta,q)=\\log p(v;\\theta) - D_{KL}(q(z|v)||p(z|v;\\theta))\n\\\\\n=\\log p(v;\\theta) - \\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim q}\\log \\frac{q(z|v)}{p(z|v)}\n\\\\\n=\\log p(v;\\theta) - \\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim q}\\log \\frac{q(z|v)}{\\frac{p(z,v;\\theta)}{p(v;\\theta)}}\n\\\\\n=\\log p(v;\\theta) - \\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim q} \\left[\\log q(z|v)-\\log p(z,v;\\theta) + \\log p(v;\\theta) \\right]\n\\\\\n=-\\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim q} \\left[\\log q(z|v) - \\log p(z,v;\\theta) \\right]\n\\end{aligned} \\tag{9}\\]\nHence a more canonical definition of the evidence lower bound can be defined as: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}(v,\\theta,q)=\\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim q} \\left[\\log p(z,v)\\right]+ H(q)\n\\end{aligned} \\tag{10}\\]\nFor an appropriate choice of \\(q,\\mathcal{L}\\) is tractable. For \\(q(z|v)\\) that approximates \\(p(z|v)\\) better, the lower bound \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is closer to \\(\\log p(v)\\). When \\(q(z|v)=p(z|v)\\), the approximation is perfect, hence, \\(\\mathcal{L}=\\log p(v;\\theta)\\). Thus, we can think of variational inference as the procedure of finding \\(q\\) that maximizes \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)."

    "text": "In silico Antibody-Peptide Epitope prediction for Personalized cancer therapy\nThe human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is a complex of genes on chromosome 6 in humans that encodes cell-surface proteins responsible for regulating the immune system. Viral peptides presented to cancer cell surfaces by the HLA trigger the immune system to kill the cells, creating Antibody-peptide epitopes (APE). This study proposes an in-silico approach to identify patient-specific APEs by applying complex networks diagnostics on a novel multiplex data structure as input for a deep learning model. The proposed analytical model identifies patient and tumor-specific APEs with as few as 20 labeled data points.\nAdditionally, the proposed data structure employs complex network theory and other statistical approaches that can better explain and reduce the black box effect of deep learning. The proposed approach achieves an F1-score of 80\\% and 93\\% on patients one and two respectively and above 90\\% on tumor-specific tasks. Additionally, it minimizes the required training time and the number of parameters.\nThe human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system or complex is a complex of genes on chromosome 6 in humans that encode cell-surface proteins responsible for regulating the immune system. The HLA system also known as the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is found in many animals.\nHLA genes are highly polymorphic, which means that there are thousands of different forms of these genes called alleles, allowing them to fine-tune the adaptive immune system. The proteins encoded by certain genes are also known as antigens, because of their historic discovery as factors in organ transplants.\nAs shown in Figure \\ref{fig:1} HLA‚Äôs proteins present viral peptides from inside the cell to the surface of the cell. For example, if the cell is infected by a virus or is cancerous, the HLA system brings abnormal fragments, called peptides, to the surface of the cell so that the cell can be destroyed by the immune system.\n\n\n\nHLA proteins (green) display peptides (red) from inside the cell to help immune cells find cancerous or infected cells\n\n\nPredicting the specific HLA peptide combination that will present the peptide to the cell‚Äôs surface permits the creation of a treatment that will trigger the human immune system to destroy the cell.\nSpecifically, in cancer, this ability is essential, given that cancer is highly mutagenic with tumor and patient-specific mutations. This means that patients with the same tumor type will have different mutations that result in different reactions to the same treatment.\nAdvances in Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing, Messenger Ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines, and high computational power allow us to work toward patient-specific therapy. This approach, called personalized mRNA-based antitumor vaccine, visualized in Figure \\ref{fig:2}, is bound to play a major role in the future.\n\n\n\nThe exome of tumor cells isolated from a biopsy sample and the exome of normal cells are compared to identify tumor-specific mutations. Point non-synonymous mutations, gene deletions, or rearrangements can give rise to neoantigens. Several bioinformatics tools are used to predict major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II binding (necessary for recognition by T cells) and RNA expression presence of the mutated antigen among tumor cells (clonality). RNA sequencing enables verification that the gene encoding the neoantigen is actually expressed by tumor cells. A tandem gene encoding several neoantigen peptides is cloned into a plasmid and transcribed to mRNA. Finally, these mRNAs are injected as naked RNA, formulated into liposomes, or loaded into dendritic cells.\n\n\nThe approach is meant to trigger an antitumor immune response in patients by challenging them with mRNAs encoding tumor-specific antigens \\citep{pastor_rna_2018}. These mRNAs can be directly injected as naked RNA or loaded into patient-derived dendritic cells.\nIn this work, we propose to extend the approach with additional laboratory and analytical optimization steps.\nConcretely DNA sequenced from the patient is used to select candidate peptides that will result from gene expression. As the space of possible combinations is huge a subset of potential peptides is synthesized and their reaction to the patient‚Äôs specific HLA alleles is tested by applying an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay.\nAn enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay \\citep{engvall_enzyme-linked_1971}, shown in Figure \\ref{fig:3}, is a highly versatile and sensitive technique that is used for qualitative and quantitative measurement of the cytokine-secreting cells at the single-cell level. \\citep{paulie_chapter_2006}\n\n\n\nVisualisation of an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) Assa"

This network structures will give us better insights and permit to apply analytical approaches to predict HLA-peptide interactions expressed as discretized class representing ranges of the numbers of matched blood mononuclear cells (PBMC‚Äôs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Sample\nA sample from the data as visualized in ?@tbl-data_sample_assays, shows 10 values of the peptide‚Äôs amino acids sequence with one letter code, the number of peptides per assay, the patients HLA‚Äôs and the measured ELISpot value i.e.¬†blood mononuclear cells (PBMC‚Äôs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nELISpot value Distribution\nAs shown in ?@fig-elispot_values_hist, we wish to look at the distribution of the ELISpot values for both patients.The medians from both patients are different as well as the distribution of the values. The values of patient one are restricted to a smaller range and show an outlier in the upper quartile. In contrast patient two shows values distributed over a wider range, again with a wider distribution in the upper quartile.\nWe can conclude that the patients show different distributions of observed PBMC values, i.e.¬†the PBMC values are patient specific.\nWarning: Use of `pationsOneandTwoDf$ELISPOTvalue` is discouraged.\n‚Ñπ Use `ELISPOTvalue` instead.\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..density..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\n‚Ñπ Please use `after_stat(density)` instead.\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

Pick better value with `binwidth`.\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\n\nPeptides nr. vs ELISpot Value\nIn ?@fig-elispot_values_violin, we graph a violin plot to analyze how the number of peptides in a system correlate with the PBMC values and specific patient. We see that patient two has systems with exclusively one peptide in contrast to patient one that has systems with one, two and three peptides. Patient one has sa high concentration of systems with only one peptide. The correlation between number of peptides and ELISPot values is not clear. Systems with one peptide seem to produce higher PBMC values in contrast to systems with multiple peptides. This conclusion should be take with caution since only patient one has systems with more than one peptide.\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\n\nNumber of Amino acids vs ELISpot values\nIn Figure¬†1, we analyze the distribution of ELISpot values in relation to the total number of Amino Acids originating from the peptides in a system. We look at these correlations for both patients individually and together. Here the difference between the patients is not so clear, we observe a pattern in both patients where the lower and the upper range of the number of patients correlate with a high ELISPot value. It is notisible that systems with 30 amino acids consistently produce PBMC values above 500 for patient two. We can conclude that systems with higher total number of amino acids in the peptides tend to produce higher ELISpot values.\n\n\n\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\nPicking joint bandwidth of 27.5\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\nPicking joint bandwidth of 169\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\nPicking joint bandwidth of 102\n\n\n¬†\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Patient vs Tot. nr.

Analyzing the coefficients we can understand the predictors influence on the produced PBMC values.\nFrom the results shown in Table¬†1, we can see that the total number of amino acids in a system have positive linear relationship with the produced PBMC‚Äôs for patient one and negative for patient two. The performance of the model differs between the two patients and the same coefficients have different linear relationship on the produced PBMC for the two patients. Hence the relationship between these coefficients and the matched PBMC value is patient specivif.

To understand and study the diverse types of relations or interactions that exist between the components we chose a network representation with a notion of layers.\nThis type of networks is called multiplex networks as shown in Figure¬†5 where a node corresponds to a ‚Äúphysical object,‚Äù while node-layer pairs are different instances of the same object. For instance a node could represent an online user, while node-layer pairs would represent different accounts of the same user in different online social networks; or a node could\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: Multiplex\n\n\nrepresent a social actor, while node-layer pairs would represent different social roles (friend, worker, family member) of the same social actor; or a node could stand for a location in a transportation network, while node-layer pairs would represent stations of different transportation modes (e.g., streets, highways, and subways).\nThe connection between nodes and node-layer pairs is given by the notion of supra-nodes: i.e., cliques in the supra-graph formed by node-layer pairs that are instances of the same object.\nTo correctly represent a physical object in the different layers of the multiplex we break down the peptides to amino acids and the amino acids to their smallest component atoms and their connections bonds. The layers coordinate, atom, monomer, polymer, complex and system are introduced.\n\nThe Atom layer, as shown in Figure¬†6, is the layer that represents the atoms and their bonds that construct objects in the monomer layer e.g., amino acid.\nThe Monomer layer, as shown in Figure¬†6, represents the objects of type monomer that is a molecule of any of a class of compounds, mostly organic, that can react with other molecules to form very large molecules, or polymers.\nThe Polymer layer, as shown in Figure¬†6, represents the objects of type polymer. Polymer is any object of a class of natural or synthetic substances composed of very large molecules, called macromolecules, which are multiples of monomers.\nThe Complex layer, as shown in Figure¬†6, represents polymers that form a complex by binding to each other e.g.¬†peptide binds to a HLA to form a complex.\nThe System layer represents the totality of complexes that exist in an ELISpot assay and is representative of multiple HLA-peptide complexes. One system could be represented as shown in Figure¬†6 where we are omitting the coordinates layer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: Multiplex Architecture"

Calculating and assigning these metrics for every individual system permits us to create a dataset that can be used in statistical, machine and deep learning analysis approaches. Additionally, we apply deep learning on graphs on the individual systems to make predictions of their interactions in this case the ELISpot result.\n\n\n\n\nSize largest Component\nIn undirected networks typically exists large components that fill most of the network, while the rest of the network is divided into a lot of small disconnected components. The size of the largest connected component can be expressed by: \\(S=1-e^{-cS}\\) introduced by Erdos and Renyi in 1958 where \\(c\\) denotes mean degree or the average of in- and out-going edges.\n\nWe compute the size of the largest component \\(S\\) of each system and and look at its distribution and correlation with the particular patient and the measured matched PBMC‚Äôs i.e.¬†ELISpot values.\n\nAs visualized in Figure¬†7, even though the medians of both patients are close, the values of patient one are better distributed with a large portion in the lower quartile.

Spectral clustering\nA fast approach to separate a network in communities is by applying spectral modularity maximization by assigning a node to one of two groups communities. If we consider \\(s\\) as a vector in n-dimensional space, that implies that the vector must point to one of the corners of the n-dimensional hypercube. By creating a relaxed method where \\(s\\) is aloud to take any value of \\(|s|=\\sqrt{n}\\) the form we arrive at a matrix notation \\(Bs=\\beta s\\). Hense the optimal \\(s\\) is on of the eigenvectors of the modularity matrix and \\(\\beta\\) is the corresponding eigenvalue. We can find which eigenvector by applying \\[Q=\\dfrac{n}{4m}\\beta\\] Since \\(s^Ts=n\\) we can maximize the inner product \\(s^Tu=\\sum_is_iu_i\\). The maximum is achieved when \\(s_iu_i\\) is positive for all \\(i\\), which occurs when \\(s_i\\) has the same sign as \\(u_i\\) for all \\(i\\): \\[s_i=\\begin{cases}\n+1, & \\text{if } u_i>0\\\\\n-1, & \\text{if }u_i<0\n\\end{cases}\\]\nThis leads to a simple approach, we calculate the eigenvector of ton the modularity matrix corresponding to the highest eigenvalue and assign nodes ot communities according to the signs of the elements in this vector.\nWe slightly modify it by assigning zero to the nodes that correspond to negative eigenvalues instead of -1: \\[s_i=\\begin{cases}\n+1, & \\text{if } u_i>0\\\\\n0, & \\text{if }u_i<0\n\\end{cases}\\] Then we calculate the average \\(\\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum_{s=1}^{n}s_i\\) of the assigned values that produces a value between zero and one and is indicative of how balanced is the distribution of the nodes between two communities.\nIn Figure¬†8 we calculate the avg. spectral clustering for each system and look at its distribution and correlation with the particular patient and the measured matched PBMC‚Äôs i.e.¬†ELISpot values.\nWe see that the distributions for both patients are quite similar. Patient two produces values that are skewed towards the lower quartile while patient one values are better distributed around the median. Even though combined data of both patients show a inverse Pearson correlation coefficient with the matched PBMC‚Äôs, patient one shows a positive correlation with statistical significance indicated by a \\(p-value<0.05\\).\nThis might indicate that there is a difference in the produced PMBC‚Äôs between patients with similar avg. spectral clustering values. In other words the systems of individual patients react differently to a similar internal node distribution between two communities.\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

C=0 implies no closed triads. Concretely we apply the Watts and Strogatz defined a clustering coefficient that quantifies the likelihood that two nodes that are connected to the same node are also connected to each other. degree to which vertices in a network tend to create tightly knit groups, closed triads: \\[ C=\\dfrac{(\\text{number of triangles})*3}{(\\text{number of connected triples})}\\] Concretely we apply the following formula \\[C=\\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum_{u=1}^{n}c_u\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of nodes and \\(c_u\\) is: \\[c_u = \\frac{2 T(u)}{deg(u)(deg(u)-1)}\\] where \\(T(u)\\) is the number of triangles through node \\(u\\) and \\(deg(u)\\) is the degree of \\(u\\).\nIn ?@fig-GlobalClusteringCoeffiecient we calculate global clustering coefficient for each system and look at its distribution and correlation with the particular patient and the measured matched PBMC‚Äôs i.e.¬†ELISpot values.\nWe see that the distributions for both patients are quite similar.

Combined data of both patients shows a positive Pearson correlation coefficient,with statistical significance indicated by a \\(p-value<0.05\\), with the matched PBMC‚Äôs. Patient one and two show a similar positive correlation.\nThis observation can imply that systems with high clustering coefficient, i.e.¬†systems where monomers, polymers and atoms that are connected to the same monomer, polymer or atom have a high likelihood to be connected to each other, will produce a higher number of matched PBMC‚Äôs.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

The question which are the most important vertices in or central nodes in a network. There are many possible definitions of importance and consequently many centrality measures. Degree, the number of incoming and outgoing edges a node has, is sometimes called degree centrality to emphasize its use as a centrality measure. Useful though it is quite a crude measure as it awards a node one centrality point for every neighbor it has. But not all neighbors are necessarily equivalent.\nIn Figure¬†10 we calculate the degree centrality for each system and look at its distribution and correlation with the particular patient and the measured matched PBMC‚Äôs i.e.¬†ELISpot values.\nWe see that the distributions for both patients are different.

Patient two shows a similar positive correlation in contrast to patient one that shows a correlation near to zero.\nFrom these observations we could imply that impact of high number of incoming and outgoing edges from the vertices in the system have a positive impact on the matched PBMC‚Äôs.

Betweenness Centrality is a guide to the influence nodes have over the flow of information, energy between others. Betweenness Centrality \\(x_i\\) is given by \\[x_i=\\sum_{st}n^{i}_{st}\\] where \\(n^{i}_{st}\\) is the node \\(i\\) that lies on the shortest path from vertice \\(s\\) to \\(t\\).\nConcretely we average the betweennes centrality \\[ \\langle x\\rangle=\\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\\]\nIn Figure¬†13 we calculate the Betweenness Centrality for each system and look at its distribution and correlation with the particular patient and the measured matched PBMC‚Äôs i.e.¬†ELISpot values.\nWe see that the distributions for both patients are different.

Eigenvector centrality is an extension of degree centrality that takes this factor into account. Eigenvector centrality awards to a node a number of points proportional to the centrality scores of its neighbors. The eigenvector centrality \\(x_i\\) of node \\(i\\) is defined to be proportional to the sum of the centralities of i‚Äôs neighbors. The eigenvector centrality \\(x_i\\) of node i is defined to be proportional to the sum of the centralities of i‚Äôs neighbors\n\\[\nx_i=k^{-1} \\sum_{\\text{nodes j}\\\\ \\text{ neighbours of i}}x_j\n\\] In matrix notation \\[x=k^{-1} Ax\\\\ Ax=kx\\] where x is the vector with elements equal to the centrality scores x_i and k is a constant. In other words, x is an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix.\nIn Figure¬†16 we calculate the average Eigen Vector Centrality for each system and look at its distribution and correlation with the particular patient and the measured matched PBMC‚Äôs i.e.¬†ELISpot values.\nWe see that the distributions for both patients are very similar.

However patient two shows an inverse correlation in contrast to positive correlation of patient one.\nFrom these observations we could imply that importance of this measure towards the impact on the matched PBMC‚Äôs is not significant and it is patient specific.\n\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

A high-centrality node pointing to one million others gives all one million of them high centrality. One could argue that this is not always appropriate. In many cases it means less if a node is only one among many that are pointed to. The centrality gained by virtue of receiving an edge from a prestigious node is diluted by being shared with so many others.\nWe can derive the following variant of Katz centrality in which the centrality we derive from the network neighbors is proportional to their centrality divided by their out-degree. \\[x_i=Œ±\\sum_jA_{ij}\\frac{x_j}{k_j^{out}} +Œ≤\\]\nIn Figure¬†17\nwe calculate the average Page Rank Centrality for each system and look at its distribution and correlation with the particular patient and the measured matched PBMC‚Äôs i.e.¬†ELISpot values.\nWe see that the distributions for both patients are very different.

Patient two has similar correlation.\nFrom these observations we could imply that systems with a high number of nodes that have a high centrality based on connections from nodes that on their turn have high centrality has a positive influence on the produced PMBC‚Äôs.

In a DAG variables are represented as vertices and conditiononal dependencies as edges. Vertices that are not connected represent conditionally independent variables. Each node is associated with a probability function that takes in, a particular set of values for the node‚Äôs parent variables, and gives the probability, or probability distribution, of the variable represented by the node.\nAs shown in ?@fig-causality, we apply a structure learning algorithm to the data in order to learn the structure of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) from the data. Concretely we apply Incremental Association (IAMB) algorithm, based on the Markov blanket detection algorithm of the same name, which is based on a two-phase selection scheme (a forward selection followed by an attempt to remove false positives).\nAnalyzing the DAG we see that the matched PBMC, vectors,Average core hubs, Attribute Assortativity Coefficient Source,Size largest component, Eigen vector Centrality and closeness centrality are conditionally dependent on the patient. This observation confirms observations made the correlation analysis. This indicates that system structures have patient specific attributes and their matched PBMC‚Äôs are as well patient specific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultivariate analysis of variance\nMultivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is a statistical procedure for comparison of multivariate sample means. It is often used when there are two or more dependent variables and we wish to perform regression analysis and analysis of variance for them by one or more factor variables or covariates.\nIn our case we wish to determine which network topology attributes are highly significantly different among patients.\nFrom the results shown in the following table, we see that Matched PBMC,Average Core hubs, Average Betweenness Centrality have a high statistical significance with \\(p-value<0.001\\).\nCloseness Centrality,Degree Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Page Rank Centrality,Attribute Assortativity Coefficient Source with \\(p-value<0.01\\)\nSize largest Component, Response Degree Centrality,Density statistical sigificance with \\(p-value<0.05\\)\nFrom this analysis we can conclude that there are indications that the produced PBMC values are statistically significantly different per patient together with a number of topological network attributes. This is agrees with the observations in the distributions and the correlations with the produced PDBC‚Äôs.\n\n\n** Response Size largest Component**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n0.002939\n0.002939\n14.29\n0.000373\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n0.01193\n0.0002058\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Laplacian clustering**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n7.603e-07\n7.603e-07\n1.128\n0.2927\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n3.91e-05\n6.742e-07\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Global Clustering Coeffiecient**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n0.0002044\n0.0002044\n0.6412\n0.4265\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n0.01849\n0.0003187\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Transitivity**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n0.01722\n0.01722\n7.502\n0.008175\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n0.1331\n0.002296\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Average degree**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n5.252e-05\n5.252e-05\n0.05573\n0.8142\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n0.05466\n0.0009424\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Average Clustering**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n6.182e-06\n6.182e-06\n3.257\n0.07631\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n0.0001101\n1.898e-06\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Degree Centrality**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n8.194e-06\n8.194e-06\n0.1305\n0.7192\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n0.003641\n6.278e-05\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Average Core hubs**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n0.0002156\n0.0002156\n0.6706\n0.4162\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n0.01865\n0.0003216\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Density**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n6.182e-06\n6.182e-06\n3.257\n0.07631\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n0.0001101\n1.898e-06\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Vectors**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n3.963e-07\n3.963e-07\n10.16\n0.002309\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n2.261e-06\n3.899e-08\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Average Betweenness Centrality**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n0.07884\n0.07884\n12.39\n0.0008457\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n0.3689\n0.006361\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Closeness Centrality**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n3.551e-07\n3.551e-07\n10.16\n0.002309\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n2.026e-06\n3.493e-08\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Degree Pearson Correlation Coefficient**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n6316\n6316\n1.078\n0.3036\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n339962\n5861\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Eigenvector Centrality**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n1.618e-08\n1.618e-08\n13.68\n0.0004833\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n6.86e-08\n1.183e-09\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Page Rank Centrality**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n0.001067\n0.001067\n11.91\n0.001046\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n0.005193\n8.954e-05\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Attribute Assortativity Coefficient Type**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n0.0005459\n0.0005459\n7.848\n0.006903\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n0.004034\n6.955e-05\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Attribute Assortativity Coefficient Source**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n8.284e-08\n8.284e-08\n0.04645\n0.8301\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n0.0001034\n1.783e-06\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n** Response Matched PBMC**:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(>F)\n\n\n\n\nPatient\n1\n2.488e-08\n2.488e-08\n10.01\n0.002478\n\n\nResiduals\n58\n1.442e-07\n2.486e-09\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n% Table created by stargazer v.5.2.3 by Marek Hlavac, Social Policy Institute.
