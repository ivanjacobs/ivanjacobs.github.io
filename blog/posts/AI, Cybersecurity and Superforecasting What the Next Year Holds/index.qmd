# Introduction

![](images/clipboard-3150065742.png)

The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both transformative opportunities and complex risks.\
The **2024 CCAPAC Report on AI and Cybersecurity** highlighted how Asia-Pacific economies are at the forefront of AI adoption while also being exposed to new forms of cyber risk.

At the same time, advances in **AI capabilities**—from foundation models to reasoning techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Graph of Thoughts—are pushing the frontier of what AI systems can achieve.

To explore the **near-term future of AI**, this article merges insights from the CCAPAC report with a **causal graph** of technological capabilities, limitations, advancements, business drivers, and risks. Using **superforecasting methods**, we derive **probabilistic predictions** for where the field will be in the next 12 months.

# The Causal Graph: Capabilities and Challenges

The graph maps out interdependencies between:

-   **Technological Capabilities** (e.g., Foundation Models, NLP, Computer Vision, Planning Algorithms, Multi-modal Models)\
-   **Limitations and Challenges** (e.g., limited reasoning, safety/security concerns, biases, computational intensity)\
-   **Advancements and Investments** (e.g., research, autonomous agents, new frameworks, verification methods, integration with external tools)\
-   **Business Drivers and Outcomes** (e.g., industry transformation, demand for decision-making systems, productivity growth)\
-   **Barriers and Risks** (e.g., regulation, public trust, cybersecurity threats)

These nodes are connected through **edges** and **feedback loops** that highlight virtuous cycles (e.g., industry transformation → demand for better decision-making → stronger agentic AI systems) and vicious cycles (e.g., biases → trust erosion → regulatory pressure).

# Key Insights

1.  **Reasoning bottleneck**\
    Despite rapid advances in models, **limited reasoning capabilities** remain a central constraint. Improvements in verification, refinement, and external tool use are crucial to progress.

2.  **Cybersecurity as systemic risk**\
    AI not only faces risks like data poisoning and model theft but also **amplifies cyber threats** through deepfakes and automated attacks. These risks reinforce regulatory scrutiny and influence public trust.

3.  **Feedback-driven acceleration**\
    Loops involving **industry transformation** and **agentic AI adoption** suggest that once certain breakthroughs (e.g., reliable planning + tool integration) occur, deployment accelerates across sectors.

4.  **Investment as a catalyst**\
    Research, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are positioned as key accelerators, enabling new frameworks for reasoning and validation.

# Superforecasting Predictions (One Year Horizon)

Applying **superforecasting methods**—base rates, trend extrapolation, and scenario weighting—we can generate **probabilistic forecasts** for 2025–2026.

## 1. Foundation Models and Multi-modal AI

-   **Prediction:** A major multi-modal foundation model (vision + text + audio) will achieve **broad commercial deployment** within 12 months.\
-   **Probability:** \~75%\
-   **Reasoning:** Trend in GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude Sonnet suggests rapid multi-modal rollout; compute and R&D investment are aligned.

## 2. Agentic AI Systems in Industry

-   **Prediction:** At least **three Fortune 500 companies** will announce production deployment of **agentic AI systems** (autonomous workflows integrating planning + external tools).\
-   **Probability:** \~65%\
-   **Reasoning:** Demand for decision-support automation is strong in finance, logistics, and customer service; barriers are trust and reliability.

## 3. Cybersecurity Threats from AI

-   **Prediction:** A **high-profile cyber incident involving generative AI** (e.g., deepfake-enabled fraud or AI-powered phishing at scale) will occur in Asia-Pacific.\
-   **Probability:** \~70%\
-   **Reasoning:** CCAPAC identifies these as immediate risks; attack surface is growing faster than defensive maturity.

## 4. Regulatory Response

-   **Prediction:** At least **two Asia-Pacific governments** will update **national cybersecurity strategies** with explicit AI-focused provisions.\
-   **Probability:** \~80%\
-   **Reasoning:** Following Singapore, Japan, and South Korea, other APAC nations will move quickly due to both opportunity and risk.

## 5. Reasoning Breakthroughs

-   **Prediction:** Methods like **Tree of Thought (ToT)**, **Graph of Thoughts (GoT)**, or **verification + refinement loops** will become **standard components** of commercial LLM frameworks.\
-   **Probability:** \~60%\
-   **Reasoning:** Academic prototypes exist; adoption depends on computational cost vs. commercial benefit.

## 6. Public Trust and Acceptance

-   **Prediction:** Public trust in AI will **decline slightly** due to visible misuse (deepfakes, biased outputs), even as corporate adoption grows.\
-   **Probability:** \~65%\
-   **Reasoning:** Trust erosion often lags adoption; governments will respond with stronger ethical and security guidelines.

# Implications for Strategy

-   **For Policymakers:** Regulatory agility is key—balancing innovation incentives with strict guardrails for security and ethics.\
-   **For Industry:** Invest early in **verification, transparency, and explainability** to gain trust advantages.\
-   **For Researchers:** Focus on **reasoning-enhancing methods** and **secure integration of tools** to overcome bottlenecks.

## Scenario Analysis: One-Year Outlook

Superforecasting is not only about assigning probabilities but also about **imagining plausible scenarios**.\
Here we outline three contrasting narratives for AI and cybersecurity over the next 12 months.

| Scenario | Description | Likelihood | Implications |
|----|----|----|----|
| **Best Case** | Breakthroughs in multi-modal and reasoning methods lead to rapid adoption of secure, agentic AI systems. Governments act quickly on regulation, and trust in AI grows. | \~20% | Productivity gains accelerate, Asia-Pacific emerges as a global leader in secure AI deployment. |
| **Base Case** | AI capabilities (multi-modal + agentic) expand, but cybersecurity incidents and misuse (deepfakes, bias) undermine public trust. Governments update policies reactively. | \~60% | Adoption continues but unevenly, with stricter regulations and selective industry wins. |
| **Worst Case** | High-profile AI-driven cyberattacks erode trust, regulatory backlash stalls innovation, and reasoning methods fail to mature fast enough. | \~20% | Slowed adoption, fragmented markets, and delayed realization of AI-driven productivity gains. |

The **base case** remains the most likely, reflecting strong technological progress but tempered by cybersecurity and governance challenges.

# Conclusion

The next 12 months will mark a **transition period**: AI capabilities will accelerate, especially in multi-modality and agentic workflows, but **cybersecurity risks and public trust** will be the critical limiting factors.

In superforecasting terms:\
- **Technological breakthroughs** are highly probable.\
- **Cybersecurity incidents** are almost inevitable.\
- **Policy and trust dynamics** will determine the pace of sustainable adoption.

The causal graph helps us see that **progress is not linear**—it emerges from reinforcing loops of capabilities, challenges, and responses. By anticipating these feedbacks, we can better prepare for an AI future that is both powerful and secure.
