Using **superforecasting methods**, we derive **probabilistic predictions** for where the field will be in the next 12 months.\n\n# The Causal Graph: Capabilities and Challenges\n\nThe graph maps out interdependencies between:\n\n-   **Technological Capabilities** (e.g., Foundation Models, NLP, Computer Vision, Planning Algorithms, Multi-modal Models)\\\n-   **Limitations and Challenges** (e.g., limited reasoning, safety/security concerns, biases, computational intensity)\\\n-   **Advancements and Investments** (e.g., research, autonomous agents, new frameworks, verification methods, integration with external tools)\\\n-   **Business Drivers and Outcomes** (e.g., industry transformation, demand for decision-making systems, productivity growth)\\\n-   **Barriers and Risks** (e.g., regulation, public trust, cybersecurity threats)\n\nThese nodes are connected through **edges** and **feedback loops** that highlight virtuous cycles (e.g., industry transformation → demand for better decision-making → stronger agentic AI systems) and vicious cycles (e.g., biases → trust erosion → regulatory pressure).\n\n![](images/clipboard-3575819498.png)\n\n# Key Insights\n\n1.  **Reasoning bottleneck**\\\n    Despite rapid advances in models, **limited reasoning capabilities** remain a central constraint. Improvements in verification, refinement, and external tool use are crucial to progress.\n\n2.  **Cybersecurity as systemic risk**\\\n    AI not only faces risks like data poisoning and model theft but also **amplifies cyber threats** through deepfakes and automated attacks. These risks reinforce regulatory scrutiny and influence public trust.\n\n3.  **Feedback-driven acceleration**\\\n    Loops involving **industry transformation** and **agentic AI adoption** suggest that once certain breakthroughs (e.g., reliable planning + tool integration) occur, deployment accelerates across sectors.\n\n4.  **Investment as a catalyst**\\\n    Research, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are positioned as key accelerators, enabling new frameworks for reasoning and validation.\n\n# Superforecasting Predictions (One Year Horizon)\n\nApplying **superforecasting methods**—base rates, trend extrapolation, and scenario weighting—we can generate **probabilistic forecasts** for 2025–2026.\n\n## 1. Foundation Models and Multi-modal AI\n\n-   **Prediction:** A major multi-modal foundation model (vision + text + audio) will achieve **broad commercial deployment** within 12 months.\\\n-   **Probability:** \\~75%\\\n-   **Reasoning:** Trend in GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude Sonnet suggests rapid multi-modal rollout; compute and R&D investment are aligned.\n\n## 2. Agentic AI Systems in Industry\n\n-   **Prediction:** At least **three Fortune 500 companies** will announce production deployment of **agentic AI systems** (autonomous workflows integrating planning + external tools).\\\n-   **Probability:** \\~65%\\\n-   **Reasoning:** Demand for decision-support automation is strong in finance, logistics, and customer service; barriers are trust and reliability.\n\n## 3. Cybersecurity Threats from AI\n\n-   **Prediction:** A **high-profile cyber incident involving generative AI** (e.g., deepfake-enabled fraud or AI-powered phishing at scale) will occur in Asia-Pacific.\\\n-   **Probability:** \\~70%\\\n-   **Reasoning:** CCAPAC identifies these as immediate risks; attack surface is growing faster than defensive maturity.\n\n## 4. Regulatory Response\n\n-   **Prediction:** At least **two Asia-Pacific governments** will update **national cybersecurity strategies** with explicit AI-focused provisions.\\\n-   **Probability:** \\~80%\\\n-   **Reasoning:** Following Singapore, Japan, and South Korea, other APAC nations will move quickly due to both opportunity and risk.\n\n## 5. Reasoning Breakthroughs\n\n-   **Prediction:** Methods like **Tree of Thought (ToT)**, **Graph of Thoughts (GoT)**, or **verification + refinement loops** will become **standard components** of commercial LLM frameworks.\\\n-   **Probability:** \\~60%\\\n-   **Reasoning:** Academic prototypes exist; adoption depends on computational cost vs. commercial benefit.\n\n## 6. Public Trust and Acceptance\n\n-   **Prediction:** Public trust in AI will **decline slightly** due to visible misuse (deepfakes, biased outputs), even as corporate adoption grows.\\\n-   **Probability:** \\~65%\\\n-   **Reasoning:** Trust erosion often lags adoption; governments will respond with stronger ethical and security guidelines.\n\n# Implications for Strategy\n\n-   **For Policymakers:** Regulatory agility is key—balancing innovation incentives with strict guardrails for security and ethics.\\\n-   **For Industry:** Invest early in **verification, transparency, and explainability** to gain trust advantages.\\\n-   **For Researchers:** Focus on **reasoning-enhancing methods** and **secure integration of tools** to overcome bottlenecks.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n![](ai_graph.svg)\n\n\n## Scenario Analysis: One-Year Outlook\n\nSuperforecasting is not only about assigning probabilities but also about **imagining plausible scenarios**.\\\nHere we outline three contrasting narratives for AI and cybersecurity over the next 12 months.\n\n| Scenario | Description | Likelihood | Implications |\n|----------------|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Best Case** | Breakthroughs in multi-modal and reasoning methods lead to rapid adoption of secure, agentic AI systems. Governments act quickly on regulation, and trust in AI grows. | \\~20% | Productivity gains accelerate, Asia-Pacific emerges as a global leader in secure AI deployment. |\n| **Base Case** | AI capabilities (multi-modal + agentic) expand, but cybersecurity incidents and misuse (deepfakes, bias) undermine public trust. Governments update policies reactively. | \\~60% | Adoption continues but unevenly, with stricter regulations and selective industry wins. |\n| **Worst Case** | High-profile AI-driven cyberattacks erode trust, regulatory backlash stalls innovation, and reasoning methods fail to mature fast enough. | \\~20% | Slowed adoption, fragmented markets, and delayed realization of AI-driven productivity gains. |\n\nThe **base case** remains the most likely, reflecting strong technological progress but tempered by cybersecurity and governance challenges.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe next 12 months will mark a **transition period**: AI capabilities will accelerate, especially in multi-modality and agentic workflows, but **cybersecurity risks and public trust** will be the critical limiting factors.\n\nIn superforecasting terms:\\\n- **Technological breakthroughs** are highly probable.\\\n- **Cybersecurity incidents** are almost inevitable.\\\n- **Policy and trust dynamics** will determine the pace of sustainable adoption.\n\nThe causal graph helps us see that **progress is not linear**—it emerges from reinforcing loops of capabilities, challenges, and responses. By anticipating these feedbacks, we can better prepare for an AI future that is both powerful and secure.\n",
